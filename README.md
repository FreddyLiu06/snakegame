## Snake Game
### Description
This is a snake game that I built for a class project at the University of Pennsylvania. It was a project that spanned multiple weeks and was used to demonstrate my understanding of the coding concepts that we learned during the class. More details regarding this game can be found below.

### Running the game
Download the folder and run the `Game.java` java file that is found in the path `./src/main/java/org/cis120` folder found [here](./src/main/java/org/cis120).
A Java version of 8 or higher is required to run the game

### Implementation
To read more about the details of the implementation of the game, please have a look at [this document](./README.txt)

### Other files
Below are some of the other more notable files in the repository
- JUnit testing  
I implemented some JUnit tests to test my game and make sure that the features and functions were working properly and taking care of edge cases. These can be found in the file `./src/test/java/org/cis120/snakegame/GameTest.java` or you can follow the link [here](./src/test/java/org/cis120/snakegame)
- Class files
Most of the Java class files that I used to develop the game can be found at `./src/main/java/org/cis120/snakegame`, or at the link [here](./src/test/java/org/cis120/snakegame)

## Snake Game
### Description
This is a snake game that I built for a class project at the University of Pennsylvania. It was a project that spanned multiple weeks and was used to demonstrate my understanding of the coding concepts that we learned during the class. More details regarding this game can be found below.

### Running the game
Download the folder and run the `Game.java` java file that is found in the path `./src/main/java/org/cis120` folder.
A Java version of 8 or higher is required to run the game
